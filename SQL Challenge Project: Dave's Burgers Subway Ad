--What are the column names?
SELECT *

--How recent is this data?
SELECT DISTINCT order_date

-- Instead of selecting all the columns using *, write a query that selects only the special_instructions column. Limit the result to 20 rows
SELECT special_instructions

-- Let’s go even further and sort the instructions in alphabetical order (A-Z)
SELECT special_instructions

-- Let’s search for special instructions that have the word ‘sauce’
SELECT special_instructions

-- Let’s search for special instructions that have the word ‘box’

-- Instead of just returning the special instructions, also return their order ids. For more readability: rename id as ‘#’, rename special_instructions as ‘Notes’
SELECT id AS '#', special_instructions AS 'Notes'
